# Introduction to Building Front-End Applications with React

## Objectives

1. Explain the topics this course will cover
2. Describe this course's approach to React
3. Briefly describe React

## Overview

Walk students through this course. What topics will they cover? What should they
already know?

Also explain that this first unit _should_ be review for them — if they
struggle, they can brush up before moving on. Put another way, let students
know that it's okay for this first unit to be super easy — just want to make
sure that they have the basics down before diving into anything new.
